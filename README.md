# KyWeather

## Introduction

This is a weather application built with Angular that allows users to:

* See the current weather conditions for their location (if permission is granted).
* Search for weather information in any city worldwide.

The app displays the following weather data:

* City and State
* Current Date and Time
* Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
* Current temperature in Celsius
* Weather icon image
* Hourly forecast for the next few hours
* Daily forecast for the next 2 days (limited by API plan)

Key Features:

* Location-based weather on user permission.
* City search functionality with weather data update.
* Clean and user-friendly interface.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
